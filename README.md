# Angular Learning Projects

This repository contains my Angular learning projects. I'm building various applications and components to practice my Angular skills, from fundamental concepts to more advanced features. Each project focuses on specific aspects of the Angular framework.

## Projects

### 1. House Tutorial
**Description:** A project to get familiar with the basic structure of Angular applications and fundamental concepts like components, templates, data binding, and routing. This is a small app that displays information about houses, including details and structure.

**Goal:** Gain a general understanding of how to build Angular applications and how the core framework concepts work together.

### 2. Udemy Components
**Description:** An application built to practice creating and using Angular components. Here, I focus on building independent, reusable components. Each component has its own template, styles, and logic.

**Goal:** Learn how to create isolated components, communicate between parent and child components using `@Input` and `@Output`, and organize an application's structure effectively.

### 3. Udemy Directives
**Description:** This project focuses on learning Angular directives. I explore how structural directives (like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`) work, as well as how to create custom directives to control the behavior of DOM elements.

**Goal:** Master the creation and use of directives for dynamic DOM manipulation and adding additional behavior to elements.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-URL>
   ```
2. Navigate to a project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in a browser to view the project.

## Purpose

This repository helps me build my Angular knowledge step-by-step, with practical exercises and code samples that I can reference in future projects.

## TODO

- Add more examples related to working with services and HTTP requests.
- Explore and implement Reactive Forms.
- Add a project to practice RxJS and asynchronous operations.
